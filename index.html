						<td>Joleta Petty: Maybe it's the fact that I went into the movie expecting a washed out attempt at squeezing a little extra coin out of a proven cash cow, or perhaps the Six Idiots sprinkled a little of their magic, but I absolutely loved this movie! I loved seeing Timothee Chalamet do something other than smoulder moodily in the dark; his role as Wonka really showcases his range and proves that he may even be close to the talent the critics insist he is. And it was a delightful surprise to see Matthew Baynton and Simon Farnaby - their flair for hilarious songs that tell a story was particularly evident in "Sweet Tooth", which would have got right in to a Yonderland episode. 
Some pessimists might find it a little insipid, but the general tone of whimsy in a dreary world took me back to the first time I saw that amazing candy wonderland in the original Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, the nostalgia and hope brought on a few tears. The plot was simple enough for a child to follow but chaotic enough -- in the way only Wonka can be -- that I wasn't bored by seeing too far ahead.</td>

						<td>Matthias Zeng: This movie is breathtaking. This movie is perfect in terms of what I personally want in a Spider-Verse film. Great characters, great visuals, great music you name it. This film's visuals is absolutely incredible and his definitely the most beautiful animation I've probably ever seen in a film. Even when the movie has it's slow moments, things are moving in the backgrounds, and it makes the movie enjoyable 100% of the time. Even if this film had a mediocre story, it would still get praised for it's animation, but it has both. The story for this film is such a blast, and the last third of the film had me on the edge of my seat the whole damn time. The overall story may seem complicated, but the film explains it in such a simple way so viewers know exactly what's going on. The characters in this film are also incredible and are more fleshed out here. We get to see a lot more of Gwen in this film and what's going on with her, and she honestly feels like the main character next to Miles. I think they did a great job handling Gwen's character, with her backstory being more in depth and the animation in her dimension is just beautiful every second it's shown. Miles is given a lot to do in this film, and honestly, he works soooo well. I liked Miles just fine in the first film, but this film shows us how much of a badass he can be. He's honestly such a well written character and I think he was handled perfectly. There are so many standout characters and if I were to go over all of them in this review, we'd be here all day. The visuals are so good in this film that it makes the first film look like a test run, in terms of the visuals and animation (and the first film looks great too so). However, sometimes the visuals are so detailed that you probably won't notice all of them in a first or even second watch, so it can feel overwhelming at times, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, because it shows how much detail and love was put in this film. Every universe and character from a different dimension is animated in a different a unique way and there are just so many art styles. Overall, this movie is such a blast to watch and is unironically the best movie I've seen in so long and is definitely up there.</td>

						<td>Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021): Comedy/Fantasy - 2hrs 4mins</td>
						<td><br>Mckenna Grace - Phoebe Spengler<br>
							Paul Rudd - Mr. Grooberson<br>
							Paterson Joseph - Slugworth<br>
							Matt Lucas - Prodnose<br>
						Mathew Baynton - Fickelbruber<br></td>
						<td>Tolkien Nerd: I really really enjoyed it. Almost as much, if not JUST as much, as spiderman: no-way home. Justin Reitman handled this movie beautifully and in my opinion, did his father proud. Additionally, the Harold Ramis dedication was heart-warming and fulfilling. Didn't feel forced or underdone. They got it exactly right.

The film had the Perfect amount of nostalgic referencing, they didn't overdo anything to fit some PC agenda and Paul Rudd didn't feel like a ring in cameo which I thought he would. The visual effects tiptoed perfectly between old school 80s (even using classic animatronics) and used the exact right amount of modern CGI without overdoing it or pulling it away from a nostalgic vibe. It felt like an 80s Ghostbusters, whilst also feeling new and classic. Wonderfully balanced. I have to say also, without any spoilers...Olivia Wylds character was perfectly portrayed. Good casting choice. 5/5 from me and an absolute galaxy of improvement from the previous re-imagining/modernisation of Ghostbusters from a few years ago. 

I could not reccomend this film more.</td>
